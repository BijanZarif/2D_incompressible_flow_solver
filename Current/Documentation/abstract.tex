This report discusses the development of a CFD program for solving 2D incompressible flow, using the Stream-Vorticity formulations of the Navier Stokes equations.  The code uses $2^{nd}$ order, centered spatial discretizations, and an explicit first order temporal discretization.  The SOR and ADI method are both implemented as iterative solvers for the Poisson Equation, then compared in terms of program run time.  An order verification study is performed on the spatial discretizations used.  The program is tested by simulating a Shear Driven Cavity Flow problem, and the results are compared with a similar study done previously by Ghia Et. Al. \cite{Ghia1982}.  Finally, a grid refinement study is performed to observe the effects of a changing grid size on the numerical solution.
