Object oriented c++ program to solve 2D incompressible flow problems using stream-vorticity method. This program will be validated by simulating lid driven cavity flow, and comparing the results with literature. The project will be complete by mid May 2014, and full documentation, including methods, usage/installation/limitations and results will be included, so stay tuned! Currently VTK 6.1.0 is required to compile and run this program: http://www.vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html
